PHD Code All
This git contains all the PHD code for Reluctant learning algorithm.
This was submitted to UWS in July 2019

Code contains

ImageClassification_CIFAR10_ReluctantLearning
Python code using reluctant learning algorithm to perform classification on CIFAR 10 dataset
requires python, keras, tensorflow to execute

imageClassificatio_CIFAR10_Standard
Python standard example of training for CIFAR 10 dataset (Control for above code)

Iris c#/iris-classification
C# Iris training dataset using both standard backpropagation aglorithm and reinfocement learning algorithm adapation 
(gui controls input and data results are plotted on x,y output

iris Python	
Python Tensorflow, keras implementation of c# iris dataset example 
code contains one standard approach and one reinforcement learning apporoach

Racing_XNA_source Code/Figureof8Race
this is a XNA c# code, required XNA plugin. this code was origiinally written in 2012 as an interesting look at games and neural networking. building a neural network without a framework from scratch to understand how they are built and work.
code is more difficult to run now as XNA does not run on modern version of visual studio.
XNA code was used then as it enabled this code (version of this code) to run on a Xbox360. This was useful at the time to as run on a standard PC was very long and the xbox360 enabled faster calculations.
